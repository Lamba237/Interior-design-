            <h2>OUR SERVICES</h2>
            <p>We offer a full range of interior design services for every type of design project, including:</p>
            
            <h3>New construction</h3>
            <p>We partner with homeowners, architects and contractors from the very beginning of a project to create holistic design concepts that consider every aspect of your new home’s design. By involving the interior design team as early as possible, preferably before plans have been drawn, we can ensure the designs are customized to meet both functional and aesthetic goals.</p>

            <h3>RENOVATIONS</h3>
            <p>Whether you’re renovating a single room or an entire home, our team can help you create a space that reflects your personal style and meets your needs. We work closely with you to understand your vision and create a design that enhances your home’s existing architecture and style.</p>

            <h3>FURNITURE, FINISHES, AND ACCESSORIES</h3>
            <p>From singular room refreshes to whole home design, we leverage our network of trade-only vendors and artisans to source furniture, floor coverings, wall finishes, window treatments, lighting, and accessories to create spaces that uniquely reflect your personal aesthetic, lifestyle, and how you want to live in your home</p>

        <h3>THE DESIGN PROCESS</h3>
        <p>Interior design requires the perfect balance of creativity and pragmatism, and we embrace this duality through a robust design and management process.</p>

        <div class="dropdown">
            <h3>INITIAL CONSULTATION</h3>
            
            <p>Every project starts with an initial consultation to learn more about your project goals, preferences, timelines, and budget. We are the stewards of our clients’ dreams, and whether you are starting with a blank sheet of paper or already have a design concept in mind, we want to hear more about those dreams and discuss how we can help turn them into reality.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dropdown dropdown2">
            <h3>CONCEPTUAL DESIGN</h3>
            
            <p>In this exploratory stage, we begin to create a design concept based on a balanced consideration of your aesthetic and functional goals. We value your input and work collaboratively to inspire and create your most cherished spaces. During this stage, we will share space planning layouts, furniture plans, and inspiration images to convey our initial ideas.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dropdown dropdown3">
            <h3>DESIGN DEVELOPMENT</h3>
            
            <p>Once we have developed a vision of how you want to feel and live in your space, we will source design elements for your approval, such as furniture, fabrics, floor coverings, tile, paint colors, lighting, hardware, and wall finishes. We will include fabric and paint swatches, tile samples, and 3D renderings in our design presentations as needed. If your project involves construction, we will include floor plans and elevations and meet with your architect and contractor to collaborate on key design decisions</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dropdown dropdown4">
            <h3 style="text-transform: uppercase;">Procurement and Project Management</h3>
            
            <p>After we have finalized design selections, we manage all aspects of the procurement process, keeping you informed regarding lead times. We also manage the receipt of all deliveries to our warehouse, where they will be inspected and stored until you are ready to have them installed. If your project involves construction, we conduct regular site meetings with your architect and contractor to ensure your designs are executed as planned.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="dropdown dropdown5">
            <h3 style="text-transform: uppercase;">Install and Photograph</h3>
            
            <p>We coordinate the delivery of all furnishings, as well as the installation of special finishes (such as wallpaper and window coverings). Our team will place your furniture, install lighting, hang artwork, and add the finishing touches to complete each room. At a time that is mutually convenient, we style and photograph your gorgeous new spaces.</p>
